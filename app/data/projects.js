        "My portfolio is the one link I share with recruiters, classmates and collaborators. It brings together my projects, skills, certificates, resume and contact details, and includes a chatbot that answers questions about me in my own voice.",
      problem:
        "A PDF resume can't show working software. I needed a place where someone can see what I've built in a couple of minutes, on any device, and reach me easily.",
      goals: [
        "Present projects with real screenshots and a written case study for each",
        "Work well on phones, since many visitors come from social links",
        "Be easy to find by name in search results"
      ],
      approach:
        "Content such as skills and projects lives in data files and is rendered by reusable components, so adding a project means adding one entry. Case study pages are generated at build time from the same data.",
      features: [
        { title: "Chat with Carl", detail: "An AI assistant that answers questions about my projects, skills and contact details in first person." },
        { title: "Light and dark themes", detail: "Follows your system setting by default and remembers your choice." },
        { title: "Project case studies", detail: "Desktop and mobile previews, a screenshot gallery and a write-up for every project." },
        { title: "Certificates and resume", detail: "Dedicated pages to view each credential and my resume." },
        { title: "Search-friendly", detail: "Page metadata, Open Graph tags, a sitemap and Person structured data." }
      ],
      challenges: [
        {
          title: "Keeping the AI key private",
          problem: "Calling the Gemini API from the browser would expose the API key to anyone who opens developer tools.",
          solution:
            "The chatbot sends messages to a Next.js API route, which adds the key on the server and calls Gemini. Only the last 12 messages are sent, and the instructions keep answers limited to facts on my portfolio."
        },
        {
          title: "Theme flashing on page load",
          problem: "Pages briefly rendered in the wrong theme before React loaded.",
          solution: "A tiny script in the layout sets the theme before the page is shown, using the saved choice or the system preference."
        },
        {
          title: "Showing a lot without feeling crowded",
          problem: "The first version had gradients, animations and large sections competing for attention, so the important parts were easy to miss.",
          solution:
            "I redesigned it as a minimal, monochrome bento grid: About, Experience, Tech Stack, Projects, Certificates and Links each sit in their own card on one screen, and collapse into a single column on phones."
        }
      ],
      outcomes: [
        "A cleaner, recruiter-focused redesign of my original portfolio, built on the same project data.",
        "New projects can be added by editing a single data file."
